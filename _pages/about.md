# Hi, I am Zheshun Wu 👋



I am currently a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and Technology at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jie Liu and Prof. Zenglin Xu. Prior to this, I received my Master's degree in Information and Communication Engineering from Sun Yat-Sen University and Bachelor's degree in Information and Interaction Design from South China University of Technology  in 2020.



My research interests lie broadly in **developing efficient, robust and generalizable algorithms for communication and networked systems using machine learning theory**, with a particular focus on:

* **Efficient Training and Inference:** Distributed Machine Learning, Progressive Training, Edge Collaborative Inference.

* **Online Learning and Reinforcement Learning:** Robust Multi-armed Bandits, Sample-efficient Markov Decision Process. 

* * **Wireless Communications and Networking:** AI for communications, Wireless Sensing and Localization.
